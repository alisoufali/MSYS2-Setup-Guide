## Introduction

MSYS2 is a terminal software for microsoft windows operating system providing us different terminal shells (e.g., bash, zsh and etc.) alongside with important tools (e.g., gcc, git and etc.). It is bundeled with its own package manager and software repository letting us have access to the latest binary versions of many development necessity tools.
Although the benefits of this software are very good, the setting-up procedure, specially to configure it on Visual Studio Code might be tricky. Also there are some points in correct installation and usage which if not handled properly it might cause the program to crash.
